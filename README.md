# **Code Breaker**

## **Application Overview**

Code Breaker is a terminal-based game where the user is givven a secret code of 4 numbers that are randomly generated from 0-9, and concealed from the player. The player is then given 12 attempts to guess the secret code. If the player succeeds and guesses the code in the 12 attempts they win, if they do not, they lose. Duplicate numbers are allowed, which makes it more difficult for the player.

When creating this game, I really wanted to focus on everything working properly but also with a theme that is in relation to the time of it being made, halloween. I have put text with blood-like font at the end of the game that tells you if you have won or lost, i have also added a pumpkin to the home page, all of this was created by the use of [ASCII.](https://www.asciiart.eu/)
